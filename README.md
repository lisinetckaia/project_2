Project : Data Science Jobs Analysis 
This project aims to conduct comprehensive analysis on data scientist employment trends and salaries, in order to offer valuable insights for decision-making and strategic planning for anyone seeking employment in the industry. Furthermore, it provides essential information for corporations to establish competitive salary aligned with industry standards and regional variations.

In this Project I'm using 2 different data sets for my analysis: 
1) Data from Glassdoor from 2017 : https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/thedevastator/jobs-dataset-from-glassdoor/data
2) Data Scientists salaries in 2024 : https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/thedevastator/jobs-dataset-from-glassdoor/data
